bugs: 
when selecting two or more fields in book category it records it all.
for eg: class1 masters it 1st year


adjustments to make: 
1. make the location state as if user selects manual location 
    input will be opened 
    when selected auto it will take the browsers location or device location

2. Better UI.

3. Reduce page loads.

4. Buyer and sellers Workthrough.

5. Add book impressions for user dashboard analytics
