bugs: 
when selecting two or more fields in book category it records it all.
for eg: class1 masters it 1st year


adjustments to make:

    input will be opened 
    when selected auto it will take the browsers location or device location

2. Better UI.

3. Reduce page loads.

4. Buyer and sellers Workthrough.
